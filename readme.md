# Mech Sim

**Mech Sim** is a modular and extensible simulation framework for BattleMech combat based on the BattleMech Manual (BMM)
ruleset. The system is designed to simulate 1v1 and team-based battles using real unit data, log combat results for
analysis, and support machine learning for mech evaluation and performance prediction.

---

## 🔧 Features

- Turn-based simulation engine following BMM rules
- Support for 1v1 and N vs N battles
- `.mtf` file parsing for existing MegaMek mech definitions
- Structured combat logging (JSON-based)
- Batch execution for large-scale experiments
- Designed for extensibility: AI, rule variants, ML integration

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 21+ installed
- IntelliJ IDEA (recommended)
- Git

### Build & Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mechSim.git
   cd mechSim
   ```
2. Open in IntelliJ and allow it to import the Gradle project
3. Build and run using IntelliJ or:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew run
   ```

> By default, the main entry point is `mechsim.Main`.
